		<h2>Our Story</h2>
		<p>After operating in the consumer Short term loans space since 2014, we observed that inasmuch as short term consumer credit was good and helpful, its undesirable tendencies of trapping consumers in perpertual debt traps if not properly used did a lot of damage to society as a whole. This was because an individual in a debt trap ended up having a trickle down effect on other stakeholders such as employers, Merchants and Financial Institutions. The observation was that when an individual gets trapped in a debt trap, it led to them being financially stressed hence affecting their productivity at work, this made the employer to lose out.<br>

<br>In the case of Merchants, high interest rates led to a reduction in desposable income hence reducing how much they could buy from producers of goods and services, once again having a negative effect on the respective merchants in terms of reduced sales volume. On the part of Financial institutions, the risk of doing business with such individuals went up hence could only do so at unfavorable conditions. It was this observation which led to the conclusion that debt was leading to all stakeholders losing hence prompting the pursuit for a better way of doing things. This better way was established to be anchored on reducing the risk of doing business and the creation of a Trust based community through which members could coordinate to lower the risk of default hence leading to better conditions with regards to consumer short term loans to the benefit all stakeholders.</br></p>

		<h1>Our Idea & Why it Could be important to you</h1>

<p> The basic premise of eziit is to add a strategic twist to the conventional understanding of short term consumer debt based purchase transactions and how they are financed in light of the shortcomings of the current short term financing options such as the extremely expensive high interest payday loans. Therefore, the objective is to maintain the advantages of short term financing such as ability to quickly fill up budget shortfalls or deal with unforeseen financial constraints whilst totally exterminating the shortcomings such as being associated with extremely high interest rates by introducing by managing the risk so as to have ‚ÄúZero interest‚Äù short term product or service based loans or any type of low cost short term financing while creating value for all key stakeholders.<br>

<br> This has since been done by eziit through tinkering with the constituents of an interest rate to which each a cost is attached hence the usual exorbitant resultant interest rate. Meanwhile, product/Service based loans are are able to unlock the value of short term consumer credit because they are cashless loans which only give borrowers access to whatever they would have otherwise used cash to pay for. The basic premise being that if the need for actual cash is removed from the purchase transaction, such a development would present an opportunity to entirely remove the need for interest to be paid on short term loans hence solving the excessively high interest problem on short term financing and unlocking value for key stakeholders, starting with individual consumers, employers, merchants and financial institutions.<br>

<br> In view of the foregoing, if you are an employer and the challenge is getting or giving more value to financially stressed members of staff due to being trapped in debt but at no extra cost to you, you could be a merchant seeking profitability and/or market growth at no extra cost or maybe just a consumer looking to get more value from income, or a financial institution lookingfor low risk income streams at no extra cost, then you can ‚ÄúEasy Off‚Äù such challenges through eziit.<br>
<br> Principally, eziit is an online platform through which organizations which employ people(Employers), those who produce goods or services(Merchants), those who buy goods and services (Individuals) and Financial Institutions ( banks, insurance companies, pension funds, etc) or any similar institutions capable of underwriting purchase transactions are enabled to do business on a platform on which their interests are integrated for mutual benefit. Eziit in this case basically integrates operations to optimize short term purchase transactions much to the shared benefits of employers, Merchants, Consumers and financial institutions.The transactions under consideration are essentially ‚ÄúTrust Based Transactions‚Äù were a payment for a product/service or the delivery of a product/service is to be done at a future date though in the short term.
